== Prometheus ServiceMonitors

When a port exposed on a container is to be used to serve metrics to Prometheus this often requires the addition of
a Prometheus `ServiceMonitor` resource. The Coherence Operator makes it simple to add a `ServiceMonitor` for an exposed
port. The advantage of specifying the `ServiceMonitor` configuration in the `Coherence` CRD spec is that the
`ServiceMonitor` resource will be created, updated and deleted as part of the lifecycle of the `Coherence` resource,
and does not need to be managed separately.
