== Overview

Since version 12.2.1.4 Coherence has had the ability to expose a http endpoint that can be used to scrape metrics.
This would typically be used to expose metrics to something like Prometheus.

NOTE: The metrics endpoint is *disabled* by default in Coherence clusters but can be enabled and configured by
setting the relevant fields in the `Coherence` CRD.


// ToDo: TBD
